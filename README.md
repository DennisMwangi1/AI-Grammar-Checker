React Application with File Processing and Grammar Check
========================================================

A full-stack application with a React TypeScript client and an Express server. This project allows users to upload and process documents with grammar checks.

### **Project Structure**

This repository is structured into two main parts:

* **Client**: A React TypeScript frontend application.

* **Server**: An Express backend server for processing requests.

### **Parent Repository Overview**

This repository contains both the **client** and **server** components. The **client** is responsible for handling user interactions and displaying grammar check results, while the **server** processes the uploaded files and performs the grammar check. Each component has its own set of instructions, which can be found in their respective README files.

#### **React Client**

The client/ directory contains the React TypeScript client application.

* **Detailed instructions for the client setup** can be found in the [Client README](https://github.com/DennisMwangi1/AI-Grammar-Checker/tree/main/AI-Assistant-Client#readme).

#### **Express Server**

The server/ directory contains the Express backend server responsible for handling requests, processing files, and performing grammar checks.

* **Detailed instructions for the server setup** can be found in the [Server README](https://github.com/DennisMwangi1/AI-Grammar-Checker/tree/main/AI-Assistant-Server#readme).

### **Getting Started**

For a quick overview, you can follow these general steps to set up both parts of the application:

1. git clone [<https://github.com/DennisMwangi1/AI-Grammar-Checker>](https://github.com/DennisMwangi1/AI-Grammar-Checker)

2. Install dependencies for both **client** and **server**:

    * `cd client && npm install`

    * `cd server && npm install`

3. The **client** will be available on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/), and the **server** will be available on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

    * `cd client && npm run dev`

    * `cd server && npm run dev`
