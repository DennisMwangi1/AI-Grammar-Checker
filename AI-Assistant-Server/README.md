Grammar Check API
=================

This is a simple Express API server that provides grammar checking functionality. The server uses a third-party grammar checking API to analyze text and return grammar errors with suggested corrections.

Features
--------

* Accepts text for grammar checking via a POST request to the /grammarCheck endpoint.

* Validates the input to ensure that it's a valid string.

* Uses a third-party grammar checking service to identify errors in the provided text.

* Returns formatted grammar errors and suggestions.

Requirements
------------

* **Node.js** (v14 or higher recommended)

* **NPM** for package management

* .env file for environment variables (see .env.example for required configuration)

Installation
------------

1. git clone <https://github.com/your-repo/grammar-check-api.git>

2. cd AI-Assistant-Server

3. npm install

4. Create a .env file in the root of the project and add the necessary environment variables. You can use the .env.example file as a template.

Environment Variables
---------------------

* PORT: The port number for the server to listen on (default is 3000).

* Other necessary environment variables (such as API keys) should be configured as per the fetchGrammarCheck function's requirements.

Usage
-----

To run the server, use the following command:

`npm run start`

The server will start and listen on the port specified in your .env file (or default to port 3000 if not specified).

### Endpoints

#### POST /grammarCheck

* **Description**: Accepts a text input, checks for grammar errors, and returns the errors and suggestions.

Dependencies
------------

* **express**: Web framework for Node.js.

* **dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a .env file.

* **cors**: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the API.

* **@types/express**: TypeScript definitions for Express.

Development

`npm run dev`

This will start the server with nodemon, which automatically restarts the server when changes are detected.
